Images are loaded by 2 different class objects.

The cell ones provide the states of a cell:
- 0-8 surrounding mines
- 9 Red mine (clicked mine)
- 10 Orange mine (shown mines when defeat)
- 11 Flag 
- 12 Green Flag (shown correctly flagged mine when game ends)
- 13 Wrong Flag (shown incorrecly flagged mine when game ends)

The scoreboard images are just digits from 0 to 9 to form the counters on the top bar of the window.
