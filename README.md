# Minesweepy

Basic minesweeper clone done with python as a hobby and to improve my skills.
(Work in progress)

Victory can be achieved by:
- Opening all the cells thar are not mines.
- By putting flags on all the mines


### Dependencies

- Tkinter for the Graphical interface.
- Numpy for the arrays containing game board data.
- Random to generate pseudo random ints to place mines on board.
- PIL to load images and use them in cells and graphical counters
